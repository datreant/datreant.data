datreant.data: convenient data storage and retrieval for Treants
================================================================

This module adds a convenience interface for data storage within a Treant's
directory structure. It was previously part of `datreant`_ itself, but 
is now its own separate module to keep the core module free of unnecessary
dependencies.
